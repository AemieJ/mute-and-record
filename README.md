# MUTE AND RECORD 

## What will this extension provide? 
The idea of the extension struck me when I was in the middle of a tutorial or a video course and I had to site and listen to online classes. Online classes at random timings didn't seem to fit with my schedule and I wasn't able to explore or work on my projects. Hence, I decided to create an extension such that for a particular tab on click, it will mute any form of audio on that tab while you can focus on listening to audio of the other tabs. On click of the extension, for that particular tab, if in mute state will become unmute.

### Extra features that the extension will provide
No matter how much a person would want to avoid classes and in this way, you could but to benefit from the academics as well, the extension will also provide the option to record the audio for the tab you require. The extension will list the state of all the muted tabs where you can control the recording status. In this manner, not only did you focus on your projects during the classes but also record the essential points during the online class making it a double win for you. 

> Note: The extension was built on this idea but it can be used for any general cases where you want to mute audio on one tab and keep it going on for the other. 

## Using the extension on your local system
All you have to do is clone the repository and go to `chrome://extension` and in the developer mode select `Load unpacked` for this particular folder. You can then use the extension to its full potential.
